            This Malak Mohamed Abd El Kareem. I’m an 15-Egyptian high school student at science technology engineering mathematics schools.
            I love to sing even though my voice is not helping and I love to do voice over since I learned from a really young age how to express your feelings using your voice tone. I’m passionate about hair care which makes me love organic chemistry in order to have my own company. This company would help every girl to solve her hair problems based on scientific evidences and experiments.
            I would be happy if I got the opportunity to go to canada and see the snow flow as it rarely snows in Egypt and never snows in my city!
